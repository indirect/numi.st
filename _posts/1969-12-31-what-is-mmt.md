Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is a framework for thinking about the relationship between the issuer of a fiat currency[^fiat] and the economy it denominates.

MMT has two basic premises:

## 1: People need money

More formally, _the fundamental value of a dollar is non-zero because the market for dollars is propped up on the demand side by taxes._

Within the United States, support for the dollar also extends to debts thanks to Â§31 U.S.C. 5103:

> United States coins and currency [including Federal Reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal Reserve Banks and national banks] are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.

In normal conditions[^hyperinflation] this creates a virtuous cycle for the currency issuer; since everyone needs dollars for their debts and taxes, employers are incentivised to pay their workers in dollars, which in turn encourages them to accept dollars for their goods and services. The ubiquity of the dollar in the economyâ€”or, put another way, people's faith that it will be useful for settling transactionsâ€”is what gives it value beyond the baseline set by taxes.

This calculus also provides a concrete answer to why the dollar is more valuable to an American than a decentralized currencyâ€”a cryptocurrency's fundamental value can be calculated in terms of the payments for which it is the only option[^ransom], which is vanishingly small compared to the dollar. It also explains why the euro isn't worth very much to most Americans[^tradecurrency].

## 2: Money is a tool, not an asset

Dollars are created and destroyed by the government; the amount (and manner) in which they are distributed or recovered is the government's most important economic (and social) policy tool.

A key point here is that _governments don't have bank accounts_. When the central bank owes a counterparty it literally conjures the payment from nothing. Likewise money collected by the government is magicked out of existence. A currency issuer's purpose is not to _have_ money, it's to _control_ money.

This turns common budgeting sense on its headâ€”a household's financial health may be determined by its bank account, but a currency issuer's financial health is determined by its economy, which it controls by adding or removing money.

The government has many options for increasing the money supply, including spending, forgiving debt, or mailing everyone a check. It mostly decreases the dollar supply by raising taxes, whichâ€”as with spendingâ€”can be used to accomplish social goals; in the same way that spending money on single-payer insurance adds dollars to the market while also benefitting public health, a wealth tax takes dollars out of the market while also reducing inequality.

This premise puts the lie to the most common complaint against public spending: "how will you pay for it?" Through the lens of MMT, the government's budget _doesn't need to balance_, the dollar economy does. Running a deficit is not the same as overspending unless it sparksâ€¦ 

## Inflation

> At its core, MMT is about replacing an artificial (revenue) constraint with a real (inflation) constraint

â€” [<cite>The Deficit Myth</cite>](https://stephaniekelton.com/book/), p72

In an otherwise static system, we can view inflation as the result of a government spending more than it collects in taxes. In the "dollar market" analogy, excess spending by the government creates an imbalance on the supply side of the market, diluting the currency.

Inflation isn't necessarily bad when it's well-controlled. A small and consistent amount[^twopercent] gradually reduces the real cost of long term debt and gently incentivizes people to maintain the economy's velocity by moving their idle cash into investments or durable goods.

That said, the economy isn't a static system. Oversimplifying, the economy "likes" a stable velocity of money, but transactions that don't involve the government can vary wildly for reasons as capricious as the people involved. In aggregate, these transactions form trends that manifest as oscillations in the market.

Through the lens of MMT, these booms and busts are opportunities for a savvy government to improve life for their citizens by spending into downturns and levelling the playing field during booms. One MMT-derived policy that accomplishes the former naturally is a job guarantee.

## A new New Deal

The "first R" of the New Deal, Relief, hired the unemployed to build infrastructure for the nation. In the same way that the government is the "lender of last resort" to distressed banks, the government made itself the employer of last resort to distressed citizens. From an MMT perspective, programs like this work well for a few reasons:

### Automatic budgeting

Instead of becoming unemployed, workers could take a job with the government during a recession, increasing the government's spending during the recession. During a healthy market, private companies would reduce the cost of the program by poaching people from public employment.

### Stabilize the economy

Obviously being employed is strictly better than needing work for the humans involved, but for the economy at large a job guarantee puts money directly where it's needed most; stabilizing people's income stabilizes their spending, which in turn stabilizes inflation.

### Minimum wage and conditions

Because the government participates in the same labour market as private industry, a public job guarantee effectively sets the minimum wage and working conditions for its citizens. This helps eliminate "bad jobs"â€”unsustainable, exploitative workâ€”from the market without harming workers.

## Anyway

This post is mostly written in terms of US dollars, but the framework applies just as well to any nation that issues their own moneyâ€”"sovereign currencies" in MMT jargon. Governments that don't control their economy's currency[^local] suffer the zero-sum rules of household budgeting[^peg], and entities like the EU live in a weird middle ground where a single distressed country has to petition the coalition to deploy monetary controls to their benefit.

[^fiat]: Money that's not backed by a commodity (like gold).
[^hyperinflation]: The exception being periods of hyperinflation, during which locals will prefer to be paid in (or immediately trade their paycheck for) a more stable currencyâ€”usually the dollarâ€”in the hope of preserving the buying power of a day's work. A relatively recent example of this can be found [in Venezuela](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/635519727).
[^ransom]: So far: paying ransoms.
[^tradecurrency]: That said, dollars _are_ worth something to Europeans because of the dollar's role as an international trade currency. The [story of how that came to be](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/526051566) is pretty bonkers. According to MMT, this props up the value of the dollar even further.
[^twopercent]: Much like the concept of [full employment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fullemployment.asp) including some non-zero percentage of unemployment, the "ideal" inflation value of 2% is simultaneously broadly accepted and completely made up. Personally, I suspect the ideal rates for both inflation and unemployment depend on the circumstances of the day.
[^local]: Countries that have undergone currency substitution, but also state and local governments.
[^peg]: Or worse, if the country has adopted an unstable currency. See: El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as an official currency (in addition to the US dollar) in September 2021.
