Figured I'd give myself a little present today; my mileage is about to increase dramatically now that I've been summoned back into the office.

This is actually the fourth Corbin seat I've owned[^doss], and my second ride-in custom. All were great, but I _highly_ recommend the custom service. They send you out with a raw foam seat (pictured above), in the usual shape for a shipped order. You return with feedback, they carve or glue on more foam, repeat until you're happy, and finally their sewers lovingly wrap it in leather/vinyl/embroidery of your own design. Make sure to sit on the pillion if you're having one made, Tanya still raves about how comfortable the SV's was[^secret].

Corbin [offers tours of their warehouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWm5rAXaRjY), but you're also welcome to wander around while your seat gets made, which is how I ran into‚Ä¶

[![the official home of Lightning Motorcycles](IMG_7495%20medium.jpeg)](IMG_7495.jpeg)

I guess they've moved out of San Jose and into Corbin's [old storage area](IMG_7489.jpeg). They've even got the Pike's Peak bike in the lobby, which set the overall motorcycle record (10:00.694!) in 2013:

[![Lightning Motorcycles shocked the industry in 2013 with this machine, which won the Pikes Peak Hillclimb outright, beating fackory-backed race teams with IC engines. Short distance racing is the killer app for e-bikes, as full power is avallable at all RPM, making wicked acoleration the norm. Lightning modified their "LS-218", the fastest production motorcycle in the world, to race at Pike's Peak with rider Carlin Dunne, and trounced the 82-bike oppositon up the 10,000 foot cimb and 12.42-mile course](IMG_7473%20medium.jpeg)](IMG_7473.jpeg)

The warehouse has a Level 2 charger for customer use, so I topped up the Zero while I explored (the ride home was 94 miles). Soon after I'd finished, an Energica with a Vetter streamliner showed up to take my place:

[![I'm not sure how to properly describe this motorcycle to a blind person, you can barely tell there's a motorcycle underneath all the bodywork; search "Vetter streamliner" if you want a trip into aerodynamic-based motorcycle hypermiling](IMG_7477%20medium.jpeg)](IMG_7477.jpeg)

I ran into the owner and we chatted for a while; the Zero isn't my first choice for long trips, but he's done a few one-day rides to San Diego (500 miles!) with this rig‚Äîdespite having a battery just over half the size[^cap], the fairing gives him the same range as me! The Energica supports DC fast charging[^level3] so five stops probably isn't a terrible nuisance, but _also_ you can get an Energica with 21.5kWh nowadays‚Ä¶

The future is exciting. Too bad I have to commute to work tomorrow‚Äîthere's rain in the forecast‚Äîbut at least I'll be comfortable!

[^doss]: The Sportster, SV, and VFR preceded the Zero
[^secret]: The secret is to dish the foam so your passenger isn't sliding around fore/aft
[^cap]: His Energica has about 10kWh capacity, my Zero stores 18kWh.
[^level3]: Not to be confused with Level 3, which [does not exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZBsOud4O9Q)
