# `<!-- ü§¶ -->`

When I was working on Mac OS X guest OS support at ·¥†·¥çware, we added some XML injection during early boot so the kernel would load kexts we needed to support the existing virtual hardware (like the PS/2 driver, since I hadn't finished writing the virtual USB keyboard yet). The year was 2009.

2019 comes around and I, along with many of my old coworkers, have moved on to Apple. One of them reaches out to me about a panic that's only happening to virtual machines. Investigation has revealed some weird XML corruption in a system file, and he thought I might have some clues. Realizing immediately what was happening, I came over and confessed my sins to a group of suitably-horrified kernel engineers.

Luckily the XML shenanigans had stopped being load-bearing when VMware adopted Hypervisor.framework, so there is now an XML comment (containing a certain emoji) at a fixed offset in that system file.
